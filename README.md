My process:

I learned alot with this project. My process was to break the project up into smaller pieces and really understand the componets before attempting to complete it. I looked at the project brief and took each section bit by bit and completed each section fully before moving on to the next. This allowed me ensure my code was correct and my code had peoper notations as well.

Grade Wanted:

I like to get Exceeds expectiation, but if I don't meet all of the requirements for exceeds, then meets is perfectly fine. I wanted to challange myself as much as I could to meet all of the excceds requirements though so I can learn as much as I could for the other projects ahead.
